# Gemini Function calling
This repository demonstrates how to interact with external APIs using function calling in Google AI's Gemini language model. It includes a Jupyter Notebook with code examples and a practical use case for currency exchange rate retrieval.

This repository demonstrates how to interact with external APIs using function calling within Gemini, a large language model from Google AI. The provided Jupyter Notebook (gemini_api_examples.ipynb) guides you through the process with a practical example of retrieving and processing currency exchange rate data.

## Content
* Introduction to function calling in Gemini.
* Setting up authentication and installing dependencies.
* Defining functions for interacting with APIs (e.g., retrieving exchange rates).
* Crafting prompts to guide Gemini in utilizing the defined functions.
* Processing API responses and generating meaningful outputs.
* A detailed example of using the Frankfurter API for currency conversion.
  
## Getting Started

Please note that this project requires a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to access and utilize the Gemini language model. This is because Gemini is currently offered as a managed service through Vertex AI, which is part of the Google Cloud platform.

Here's what you need to do:

1. Create a GCP Account: If you don't already have one, sign up for a free trial or create a new account on the [Google Cloud Platform website](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en).
   
2. Enable Vertex AI API: Once you have a GCP account, you'll need to enable the Vertex AI API for your project. Instructions on how to do this can be found in the [Vertex AI documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/cloud-environment).

3. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/isaacattuah/gemini-function-calling
```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
Open `gemini_api_examples.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

5. Follow the instructions:
The notebook provides step-by-step explanations and code examples to guide you through the process of interacting with APIs using Gemini.

Note: 

## Requirements
* Python 3.7 or higher
* Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
* Google Cloud Account
* Required Python libraries (specified in the notebook)

## Key Learnings
* Understand the principles of function calling within Gemini.
* Learn how to define functions for interacting with external APIs.
* Explore techniques for crafting effective prompts for Gemini.
* Discover how to process API responses and generate informative outputs.
* Gain practical experience with a real-world currency exchange rate example.
  
## Benefits
* Expand the capabilities of Gemini by integrating external data and functionality.
* Build dynamic and responsive applications that leverage real-time information.
* Streamline development by simplifying complex tasks with API interactions.


Feel free to experiment with the code, explore different APIs, and adapt the examples to your specific use cases.
